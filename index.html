                        A <a href="https://ocdetailpro.com/marine-detailing-granbury-tx/">detailing service</a> is an essential step in taking care of your car. When you have your vehicle detailed, all the dirt and grime are removed from its exterior and interior. This leaves it looking clean and new again. Detailing services can be done at a car wash or at a detailing shop. If you take your car to a car wash, the detailer will usually start by washing the car’s exterior. They will use a special soap that will remove all the dirt, mud, and bugs that have accumulated on the car’s surface. Then they will rinse it off with water. Next, they will move on to the interior of the vehicle. They will vacuum all the seats and carpets, then clean them with a special cleaner. They may also shampoo the upholstery if needed. The detailer will also clean all the windows inside and out and polish any chrome or other metal surfaces on the car. Finally, <a href="https://ocdetailpro.com/ceramic-coating-granbury-tx/">they will apply a coat</a> of wax to protect the paint job from scratches and fading. If you take your car to a detailing shop, they will do basically everything that a car wash does. Still, they will also do some other things like cleaning undercarriages and engine compartments. They will also usually do a more thorough job of cleaning the interior, including all the nooks and crannies.
